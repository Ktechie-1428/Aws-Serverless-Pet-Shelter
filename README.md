# AWS Serverless Pet Shelter (In Progress)

## Overview
A full-stack serverless application that allows users to view pets and submit adoption applications.  
This project is being built to demonstrate real-world cloud engineering workflows using AWS.

## Tech Stack
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon DynamoDB
- AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)
- React (Vite)
- Python

## Architecture
- Backend: Serverless microservices deployed with AWS SAM
- Frontend: React application consuming a live API Gateway endpoint
- Data: DynamoDB for pet and adoption records

## Current Status
✅ Backend deployed (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)  
🚧 Frontend integration in progress  
🚧 Error handling and UI refinement ongoing  

## What I’ve Learned So Far
- Debugging CloudFormation rollbacks
- IAM role and policy configuration for Lambda
- AWS region consistency and deployment strategies
- SAM build and deploy workflows
- Integrating a React frontend with a live AWS backend

## Next Steps
- Complete frontend API integration
- Add validation and error handling
- Deploy frontend
- Improve documentation and architecture diagrams
